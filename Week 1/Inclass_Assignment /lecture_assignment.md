# Temporal Database Management for Students and Courses

## Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is to provide an educational demonstration on the concepts and practical applications of temporal databases. Specifically, the project focuses on the implementation and understanding of key temporal elements such as transaction time, valid time, and system versioning using a simple Students and Courses database schema. By the end of this project, participants will be able to:

1. Understand the importance and application of temporal data in database management.
2. Create and manage temporal tables that track historical data and changes over time.
3. Implement and query temporal data using SQL to view historical states and manage data integrity.
4. Apply system versioning techniques to automatically manage historical data in relational databases.

## Project Steps

### 1. Database Schema Creation

Design and create tables for Students, Courses, and Enrollments, incorporating fields for temporal data management (e.g., `ValidFrom`, `ValidTo`, `TransactionStartTime`, `TransactionEndTime`).

### 2. Temporal Concepts Understanding

Explain and demonstrate the use of transaction time, valid time, and system versioning in the context of the Students and Courses database.

### 3. Data Insertion and Temporal Management

Insert records into the database while considering temporal attributes, such as the enrollment and drop dates of students in courses. Address common issues related to temporal data types (e.g., handling large future dates in `TIMESTAMP` columns).

### 4. Temporal Queries and System Versioning

Execute SQL queries to retrieve historical data at specific points in time. Illustrate the use of system versioning to automatically manage and track changes in data.

### 5. Real-World Application and Discussion

Summarize the practical applications of temporal databases in real-world scenarios, emphasizing the importance of data accuracy and historical tracking.

## Sample solutions
    - Make sure your solutions follows the diagram, e.g., add the DATTIME; etc.

### Step 1: Database Schema Creation

1. **Create the Students Table:**
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Students (
        StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        StudentName VARCHAR(100),
        DateOfBirth DATE
    );
    ```

2. **Create the Courses Table:**
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Courses (
        CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        CourseName VARCHAR(100)
    );
    ```

3. **Create the Enrollments Table:**
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
        EnrollmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        StudentID INT,
        CourseID INT,
        EnrollmentDate DATE,
        DropDate DATE,
        ValidFrom DATE,
        ValidTo DATE,
        TransactionStartTime TIMESTAMP,
        TransactionEndTime DATETIME,
        FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID),
        FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Courses(CourseID)
    ) WITH SYSTEM versioning;
    ```

### Step 3: Data Insertion and Temporal Management

1. **Insert Data into Students Table:**
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, DateOfBirth)
    VALUES (1, 'Matti', '2000-05-15'),
           (2, 'Amir', '1999-09-10');
    ```

2. **Insert Data into Courses Table:**
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO Courses (CourseID, CourseName)
    VALUES (1, 'Database Systems'),
           (2, 'Data Structures');
    ```

3. **Enroll Students in Courses with Valid Time and Transaction Time:**
    ```sql
    -- Matti enrolls in Database Systems
    INSERT INTO Enrollments (EnrollmentID, StudentID, CourseID, EnrollmentDate, DropDate, ValidFrom, ValidTo, TransactionStartTime, TransactionEndTime)
    VALUES (1, 1, 1, '2024-08-18', NULL, '2024-08-18', '9999-12-31', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '9999-12-31');

    -- Amir enrolls in Data Structures
    INSERT INTO Enrollments (EnrollmentID, StudentID, CourseID, EnrollmentDate, DropDate, ValidFrom, ValidTo, TransactionStartTime, TransactionEndTime)
    VALUES (2, 2, 2, '2024-08-19', NULL, '2024-08-19', '9999-12-31', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '9999-12-31');
    ```

### Step 4: Update Data and Explore Temporal Behavior

1. **Matti Drops the Course (Update Valid and Transaction Times):**
    ```sql
    -- Set the valid end time for Amir's current enrollment
    UPDATE Enrollments
    SET DropDate = '2024-09-01', ValidTo = '2024-09-01'
    WHERE EnrollmentID = 1;

    -- Insert a new record for Amir to indicate course drop with updated transaction time
    INSERT INTO Enrollments (EnrollmentID, StudentID, CourseID, EnrollmentDate, DropDate, ValidFrom, ValidTo, TransactionStartTime, TransactionEndTime)
    VALUES (3, 1, 1, '2024-08-18', '2024-09-01', '2024-08-18', '2024-09-01', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '9999-12-31');
    ```

2. **Amir's Enrollment is Updated Due to a Data Correction:**
    ```sql
    -- Assume the initial enrollment date was incorrect and needs to be corrected
    -- Set the valid end time for Matti's current enrollment record
    UPDATE Enrollments
    SET ValidTo = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    WHERE EnrollmentID = 2;

    -- Insert a corrected enrollment record for Amir with the right enrollment date and updated transaction time
    INSERT INTO Enrollments (EnrollmentID, StudentID, CourseID, EnrollmentDate, DropDate, ValidFrom, ValidTo, TransactionStartTime, TransactionEndTime)
    VALUES (4, 2, 2, '2024-08-20', NULL, '2024-08-20', '9999-12-31', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '9999-12-31');
    ```

### Step 5: Get the Historical Data from a System-Version Temporal Table

```sql
SELECT *, row_start AS transaction_time 
FROM Enrollments 
FOR SYSTEM_TIME ALL;
````

# In-Class Assignment for INDEX

## Step 2: Dense Index
A dense index is one that includes an index entry for every search key value, even if those values are not unique. Typically, dense indexes are more effective for columns with many unique values.

**Use Case for Dense Index:** The column DateOfBirth in the Students table is likely to have many unique values (students with different birthdates), so it makes sense to create a dense index here.
**SQL for Creating Dense Index on** DateOfBirth

```sql
-- Create a dense index on DateOfBirth column (many unique values)
CREATE INDEX idx_dob_dense ON Students (DateOfBirth);

```
Explanation:

    - The DateOfBirth column in the Students table is chosen for a dense index because birthdates will most likely be unique across students.
    - The idx_dob_dense index will be created to allow for efficient queries filtering on DateOfBirth.


## Step 3: Thin Index
A **thin index** is one that includes only a few distinct values (low cardinality) for a column. For example, creating an index on a column that stores categorical or repeated values.

**Use Case for Thin Index:** The CourseName column in the Courses table is a good candidate for a thin index, as there might be fewer unique course names (e.g., multiple students can enroll in the same course).
**SQL for Creating Thin Index on** CourseName

```sql
 -- Create a thin index on CourseName column (low cardinality)
CREATE INDEX idx_course_name_thin ON Courses (CourseName);

```
Explanation:

    - The CourseName column is a good example of low cardinality. Even though there may be many students, the number of unique course names will likely be fewer.
    - The idx_course_name_thin index will improve the performance of queries filtering by CourseName.

## Step 4: Binary Index
A *binary index* is created on a column that has two distinct values (binary or boolean values). For example, a column that stores TRUE/FALSE values, or 0/1, is a candidate for a binary index.

**Use Case for Binary Index:** The DropDate column in the Enrollments table can be treated as binary (whether a student has dropped the course or not). We can use a BOOLEAN or TINYINT column to represent if a student has dropped a course.
We will create a new column HasDropped in the Enrollments table, which stores a TRUE/FALSE value to represent whether the student has dropped the course. This column will be indexed with a binary index.

**SQL to Add HasDropped Column and Create Binary Index*

```sql
-- Add a new column to the Enrollments table to represent if a student has dropped a course
ALTER TABLE Enrollments ADD COLUMN HasDropped BOOLEAN;

-- Update the `HasDropped` column based on DropDate (if DropDate is NOT NULL, the student has dropped the course)
UPDATE Enrollments
SET HasDropped = (DropDate IS NOT NULL);

-- Create a binary index on the `HasDropped` column (TRUE/FALSE)
CREATE INDEX idx_has_dropped ON Enrollments (HasDropped);


```
Explanation:

    - The HasDropped column is added to the Enrollments table, representing whether a student has dropped the course.
    - This column is indexed as a binary index, which optimizes queries checking whether students have dropped the course or not (i.e., HasDropped = TRUE or HasDropped = FALSE).

## Step 5: Querying with the Indexes
Once the indexes are created, learners can run queries that benefit from these indexes.

**Query for Dense Index (DateOfBirth)**

```sql
-- Query using the dense index on DateOfBirth
SELECT * FROM Students
WHERE DateOfBirth = '2000-01-01';


```
This query will use the dense index on the DateOfBirth column, speeding up searches by birthdate.

**Query for Thin Index (CourseName)**

```sql

-- Query using the thin index on CourseName
SELECT * FROM Courses
WHERE CourseName = 'Mathematics 101';


```
This query will use the thin index on the CourseName column to efficiently find courses with the name 'Mathematics 101'.

**Query for Binary Index (HasDropped)**

```sql

-- Query using the binary index on HasDropped
SELECT * FROM Enrollments
WHERE HasDropped = TRUE;

```
This query will use the binary index on the HasDropped column to quickly find all records where students have dropped a course.

## Step 6: Check Index Usage with EXPLAIN
You can use the EXPLAIN command to see if MySQL is using the indexes for your queries.

For example:
```sql

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Students WHERE DateOfBirth = '2000-01-01';

```
## Step 7: Clean Up the Environment
After performing the practice, learners should clean up the environment by dropping the indexes.

**SQL to Drop Indexes**

```sql

-- Drop the indexes after practice
DROP INDEX idx_dob_dense ON Students;
DROP INDEX idx_course_name_thin ON Courses;
DROP INDEX idx_has_dropped ON Enrollments;

```
