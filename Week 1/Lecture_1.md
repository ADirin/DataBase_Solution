## Introduction
Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns. The main aim is to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. The process involves dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them.

## Why Normalize?
- **Eliminate Redundant Data:** Avoid storing the same data in multiple places.
- **Ensure Data Dependencies Make Sense:** Store related data together.
- **Improve Data Integrity:** Maintain accuracy and consistency of data over its entire lifecycle.
- **Optimize Queries:** Simplify and speed up database queries.

## Normalization Forms
Normalization is typically divided into several steps, each building on the previous one. These steps are referred to as normal forms. The most common normal forms are 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and BCNF.

### First Normal Form (1NF)
- **Definition:** A table is in 1NF if:
  - It contains only atomic (indivisible) values.
  - Each entry in a column is of the same data type.
  - Each column contains only a single value.
  - Each column has a unique name.
  - The order in which data is stored does not matter.

**Example:**

| StudentID | Name       | Courses           |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| 1         | Alice      | Math, Physics     |
| 2         | Bob        | Math, Chemistry   |

**Normalized to 1NF:**

| StudentID | Name  | Course    |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1         | Alice | Math      |
| 1         | Alice | Physics   |
| 2         | Bob   | Math      |
| 2         | Bob   | Chemistry |

### Second Normal Form (2NF)
- **Definition:** A table is in 2NF if:
  - It is in 1NF.
  - It has no partial dependency; that is, no non-prime attribute is dependent on any proper subset of any candidate key of the table.

**Example:**

| StudentID | Course    | Instructor |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 1         | Math      | Prof. A    |
| 1         | Physics   | Prof. B    |
| 2         | Math      | Prof. A    |
| 2         | Chemistry | Prof. C    |

**Normalized to 2NF:**

**Students Table:**

| StudentID | Name  |
|-----------|-------|
| 1         | Alice |
| 2         | Bob   |

**Courses Table:**

| CourseID | Course    | Instructor |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| 101      | Math      | Prof. A    |
| 102      | Physics   | Prof. B    |
| 103      | Chemistry | Prof. C    |

**Enrollment Table:**

| StudentID | CourseID |
|-----------|----------|
| 1         | 101      |
| 1         | 102      |
| 2         | 101      |
| 2         | 103      |

### Third Normal Form (3NF)
- **Definition:** A table is in 3NF if:
  - It is in 2NF.
  - It has no transitive dependency; that is, no non-prime attribute depends on another non-prime attribute.

**Example:**

**Courses Table:**

| CourseID | Course    | InstructorID |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| 101      | Math      | 1            |
| 102      | Physics   | 2            |
| 103      | Chemistry | 3            |

**Instructors Table:**

| InstructorID | InstructorName |
|--------------|----------------|
| 1            | Prof. A        |
| 2            | Prof. B        |
| 3            | Prof. C        |

### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
- **Definition:** A table is in BCNF if:
  - It is in 3NF.
  - For every one of its non-trivial functional dependencies `X -> Y`, `X` is a super key.

## Examples
### Example 1: Employee Database

**Unnormalized Table:**

| EmpID | EmpName | Dept     | DeptHead |
|-------|---------|----------|----------|
| 1     | John    | IT       | Alice    |
| 2     | Jane    | HR       | Bob      |
| 3     | Jake    | IT       | Alice    |

**1NF:**

| EmpID | EmpName | Dept     | DeptHead |
|-------|---------|----------|----------|
| 1     | John    | IT       | Alice    |
| 2     | Jane    | HR       | Bob      |
| 3     | Jake    | IT       | Alice    |

**2NF:**

**Employee Table:**

| EmpID | EmpName |
|-------|---------|
| 1     | John    |
| 2     | Jane    |
| 3     | Jake    |

**Department Table:**

**EmployeeDepartment Table:**

| EmpID | DeptID |
|-------|--------|
| 1     | 1      |
| 2     | 2      |
| 3     | 1      |

**3NF and BCNF:**

No changes are needed as there are no transitive dependencies.

## Conclusion

## Introduction
Indexing is a technique used in databases to improve the speed of data retrieval operations. An index is a data structure that allows for fast access to the rows in a table based on the values of one or more columns.

## Why Use Indexes?
- **Improve Query Performance:** Indexes significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be scanned for query execution.
- **Enhance Search Speed:** They make data retrieval operations faster.
- **Efficient Sorting:** Indexes can be used to speed up sorting and ordering of query results.
- **Enforce Uniqueness:** Unique indexes ensure that no duplicate values are entered in specific columns.

## Types of Indexes
### Primary Index
- **Definition:** An index on a set of fields that includes the unique primary key.
- **Example:** Index on the `EmployeeID` column in an `Employees` table.

### Secondary Index
- **Definition:** An index that is not a primary index and can be on any field or combination of fields.
- **Example:** Index on the `LastName` column in an `Employees` table.

### Unique Index
- **Definition:** An index that ensures all the values in the indexed column are unique.
- **Example:** Unique index on the `Email` column in a `Users` table.

### Bitmap Index
- **Definition:** An index that uses bitmaps and is efficient for columns with a low cardinality.
- **Example:** Bitmap index on the `Gender` column in a `Customers` table.

### Full-Text Index
- **Definition:** An index that allows for efficient searching of text within large text columns.
- **Example:** Full-text index on the `Description` column in a `Products` table.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Dense Indexing
- **Definition:** is a type of indexing in databases where an index entry is created for every single record in the table
_ **Example:**
# Dense Indexing

Dense indexing is a type of indexing in databases where an index entry is created for every single record in the table. This contrasts with sparse indexing, where index entries are created for only some records, usually those at certain intervals.

## Key Concepts of Dense Indexing

1. **Every Record Indexed**: In dense indexing, each record in the table has a corresponding entry in the index. This ensures that every value of the indexed column is directly associated with a specific index entry.
2. **Index Size**: Dense indexes can be larger than sparse indexes because they contain entries for every row in the table. However, they provide faster access to data because every index entry points directly to a record.
3. **Use Case**: Dense indexing is useful when queries frequently access specific records and require quick lookups, such as when searching by a unique identifier.

## Example of Dense Indexing

Let’s illustrate dense indexing with a practical example using a `students` table.

### Table Structure

Imagine a simple table `students` with the following structure:

| student_id | name         | age | major            |
|------------|--------------|-----|------------------|
| 1          | Alice Smith  | 20  | Computer Science |
| 2          | Bob Johnson  | 22  | Mathematics      |
| 3          | Carol White  | 19  | Physics          |
| 4          | David Brown  | 21  | Chemistry        |

### Dense Index on `student_id`

To create a dense index on the `student_id` column, where each `student_id` is unique, you would have:

**Index Structure:**

| student_id | Row Pointer      |
|------------|------------------|
| 1          | Pointer to Row 1 |
| 2          | Pointer to Row 2 |
| 3          | Pointer to Row 3 |
| 4          | Pointer to Row 4 |

**SQL to Create Dense Index:**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_student_id ON students (student_id);
```


### How Dense Indexing Works
- Insert Operation: When you insert a new student record into the students table, the dense index automatically includes a new entry for this student_id.
- Search Operation: To find a student by student_id, the index provides a direct pointer to the exact record, making the retrieval operation very efficient.

Example Query:
To find the record for student_id = 3, the database would use the dense index to directly access Row 3:



```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE student_id = 3;

```
The index entry for student_id = 3 provides the exact location of the record in the table, resulting in quick retrieval.

### Advantages of Dense Indexing
  - Efficient Lookups: Each query for an indexed value is very efficient because the index provides a direct reference to the record.
  - Consistency: Useful for unique or near-unique columns where every row needs to be quickly accessible.
  - Simplified Index Management: Since every record is indexed, there's no need to manage gaps in the index.
### Disadvantages of Dense Indexing
  - Storage Overhead: The index can become large, especially for tables with many rows, consuming additional storage.
  - Update Overhead: Every insert, update, or delete operation requires updating the index, which can impact performance in write-heavy scenarios.


## thin(Sparse) Indexing
- **Definition:** is a type of indexing in databases where index entries are created for only some records, usually those at certain intervals.
_ **Example:**

# Thin Indexing Example

**Thin indexing**, also known as **sparse indexing**, involves creating index entries for only a subset of the records in a table rather than every record. This approach can save space and improve performance when dealing with large tables or infrequent query patterns. Unlike **dense indexing**, where every record has an index entry, thin indexing creates entries for only some records, often at regular intervals.

## Example of Thin Indexing

Consider a `products` table in a database where you want to create a sparse index on the `product_id` column. Instead of indexing every record, you might choose to index every 100th record.

### Table Structure

Let’s assume the `products` table has the following columns:

| product_id | name          | price | category_id |
|------------|---------------|-------|-------------|
| 1          | Widget A       | 10.99 | 1           |
| 2          | Widget B       | 12.99 | 1           |
| 3          | Widget C       | 8.99  | 2           |
| 4          | Widget D       | 15.99 | 2           |
| ...        | ...           | ...   | ...         |
| 1000       | Widget Z       | 9.99  | 3           |

### Creating a Thin Index

**Objective**: Create an index on `product_id`, but only for every 100th record.

**Index Structure:**

In a thin index, entries are not created for every record but at intervals. For instance:

| product_id | Row Pointer   |
|------------|---------------|
| 100        | Pointer to Row 100 |
| 200        | Pointer to Row 200 |
| 300        | Pointer to Row 300 |
| ...        | ...               |

**SQL to Create a Sparse Index:**

Thin indexing usually involves a custom approach because standard SQL indexing mechanisms don’t support this directly. However, you can create a standard index and then selectively manage it to simulate thin indexing.

1. **Create a Full Index:**

   Create a full index first for all records.
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_product_id ON products (product_id);

   ```

2. Implement Custom Indexing Logic:
    To simulate thin indexing, you would manually manage the index entries based on your requirements. For instance, if you're using a custom application or script, you could only query and     maintain index entries at certain intervals.

3. Use a Secondary Table (Example):
    Create a secondary table to store index entries at desired intervals:

```sql

CREATE TABLE sparse_index (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    row_pointer INT
);

-- Populate the sparse index manually or via a script
INSERT INTO sparse_index (product_id, row_pointer)
SELECT product_id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY product_id)
FROM products
WHERE MOD(product_id, 100) = 0;
```
In this example, only every 100th record is indexed. This is a simplified representation, and in practice, you would use a more automated approach to maintain and query such sparse indexes.

Querying with Thin Index
When querying the products table, you would look up the sparse_index table first to find a pointer or record efficiently.

Example Query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE product_id IN (SELECT product_id FROM sparse_index WHERE product_id = 200);


```
### Advantages of Thin Indexing
1. Space Efficiency: Consumes less space compared to dense indexing as it only includes a subset of the records.
2. Reduced Overhead: Decreases the overhead associated with maintaining the index, especially in write-heavy scenarios.

### Disadvantages of Thin Indexing
1. Potential Performance Trade-Off: Accessing records that are not directly indexed might be slower, as additional lookups or scans are required.
2. Complexity in Management: Requires custom logic to maintain and query the sparse index effectively.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Index Structures
### B-Tree Index
- **Definition:** A balanced tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.
- **Usage:** General-purpose indexing, especially for range queries.


> [Watch this youtube video]([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZjYr87r1b8&t=2232s)



### Hash Index
- **Definition:** An index that uses a hash table to map keys to their corresponding values.
- **Usage:** Exact match queries, not suitable for range queries.

### Bitmap Index Structure
- **Definition:** An index that uses bitmaps to represent the presence or absence of a value.
- **Usage:** Columns with low cardinality, such as gender or boolean fields.

## Design Considerations
### Choosing Columns to Index
- **Frequency of Use:** Index columns that are frequently used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY clauses.
- **Selectivity:** Choose columns with high selectivity, where the indexed column values are unique or have few duplicates.
- **Update Frequency:** Be cautious with indexing columns that are frequently updated, as this can degrade performance.

### Index Maintenance
- **Rebuilding Indexes:** Regularly rebuild indexes to defragment and optimize them.
- **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor index usage and performance to ensure they are beneficial.

### Indexing and Performance
- **Trade-offs:** While indexes improve read performance, they can slow down write operations.
- **Size Considerations:** Indexes take up additional disk space, so balance the number and size of indexes.

## Examples
### Example 1: Employee Database

**Creating an Index on `LastName`:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON Employees (LastName);
````
Creating a Unique Index on Email:
```sql

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email ON Users (Email);
````
### Example 2: E-commerce Database
Creating a Full-Text Index on ProductDescription:

```sql
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX ft_idx_description ON Products (Description);
````
Creating a Bitmap Index on Category:

```sql
CREATE BITMAP INDEX idx_category ON Products (Category);
````


# Best Practices
Use Indexes Sparingly: Index only those columns that will benefit the most from indexing.
Composite Indexes: Use composite indexes for queries that filter on multiple columns.
Analyze Query Patterns: Regularly analyze and optimize query patterns to determine the need for indexes.
Monitor Performance: Continuously monitor the performance impact of indexes and adjust as necessary.
Conclusion
Indexing is a powerful tool for improving database performance, but it must be used judiciously. 
By understanding the different types of indexes and their use cases, you can design an efficient indexing strategy that balances the benefits and trade-offs.

|------------|-------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1          | Alice | IT         | 2023-01-01  | 2023-12-31  |
| 1          | Alice | HR         | 2024-01-01  | 9999-12-31  |

## Design Considerations
### Time Dimensions
- **Multiple Time Dimensions:** Incorporate both valid time and transaction time for comprehensive temporal data management.
- **Time Granularity:** Define the granularity of time (e.g., day, month, year) based on application requirements.

### Primary and Foreign Keys
- **Composite Keys:** Use composite keys that include time dimensions to uniquely identify records.
- **Referential Integrity:** Ensure foreign keys maintain referential integrity over time.

# System-Versioned Tables in MariaDB

In MariaDB, to view the transaction time (also known as system versioning), you can use system-versioned tables, which are a feature that allows the database to automatically record and keep track of the history of all changes made to the data in a table.

## 1. Creating a System-Versioned Table

To create a system-versioned table in MariaDB, you need to define `WITH SYSTEM VERSIONING` when creating the table. You must include two additional timestamp columns: `ROW_START` and `ROW_END`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    dept_id INT,
    row_start TIMESTAMP(6) GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW START,
    row_end TIMESTAMP(6) GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW END,
    PERIOD FOR SYSTEM_TIME (row_start, row_end)
) WITH SYSTEM VERSIONING;
```

## 2. Inserting Data
When you insert data into a system-versioned table, MariaDB will automatically manage the row_start and row_end columns.


```sql

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, salary, dept_id)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000, 101);
```
## 3. Updating Data
When you update data, the old record is archived with its transaction times, and a new record is created with the updated information.

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 55000
WHERE employee_id = 1;

```
## 4. Viewing Transaction Time
You can use the FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause to query the history of changes and view the transaction times.

```sql

SELECT * FROM employees
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF NOW();

```

Viewing Historical Data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
FOR SYSTEM_TIME ALL;
```
This query will return all versions of the rows, including the transaction times (i.e., the row_start and row_end timestamps).

Viewing Data at a Specific Point in Time:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2024-08-01 12:00:00';
```
This query returns the rows that were valid at the specified time.

## 5. Important Considerations
Performance: System-versioned tables store historical data, so they can grow large. Regular maintenance or archiving strategies might be necessary.
System Time Precision: Ensure that your MariaDB installation supports sufficient precision for the TIMESTAMP columns if you need high-resolution transaction times.

# Modeling-History-Tables

Historical data modeling is essential for maintaining an audit trail, tracking data changes, and supporting temporal queries. Below is a detailed explanation of how to model history tables and fields in a database schema, including different approaches, considerations, and examples.

## 1. Introduction to Historical Data Modeling

Historical data modeling involves creating a database schema that can capture and store the state of data at different points in time. This is crucial for scenarios where it's necessary to:

- Audit changes made to records.
- Restore previous states of data.
- Analyze trends over time.

## 2. Approaches to Historical Data Modeling

### A. Using History Tables

History tables are separate tables that store old versions of records from a main table. When a record in the main table is modified or deleted, the previous version of the record is inserted into the history table.

#### Structure of a History Table:

- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each record in the history table, often including a composite key of the original record's primary key and a version or timestamp.
- **Data Columns**: These mirror the columns of the main table, capturing the state of the data at the time of change.
- **Metadata Columns**: Additional columns to capture metadata about the change, such as:
  - `operation_type` (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
  - `transaction_time` (e.g., using NOW() to record the exact time of the change)
  - `user_id` (to capture who made the change, if applicable)

#### Example:

Suppose you have a `persons` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE persons (
    person_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    age INT,
    address TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
The corresponding history table might look like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE persons_history (
    history_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    person_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    age INT,
    address TEXT,
    transaction_time TIMESTAMP,
    operation_type VARCHAR(10),
    user_id INT
) with system versioning;
```

# B. Using Temporal Columns in the Main Table
Another approach is to store historical information directly within the main table by adding temporal columns.

Common Temporal Columns:
_ valid_from: The timestamp when the record became valid.
_ valid_to: The timestamp when the record was superseded or deleted.
_ created_at, updated_at: Timestamps for when the record was inserted and last modified.

Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE persons (
    person_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    age INT,
    address TEXT,
    valid_from TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    valid_to TIMESTAMP DEFAULT '9999-12-31',  -- Indicates the record is currently valid
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
## Implementation:
When a record is updated, the valid_to field of the current record is set to the current time, and a new record is inserted with an updated valid_from timestamp.

Update Example:


```sql
-- Mark current record as expired
UPDATE persons
SET valid_to = NOW(), updated_at = NOW()
WHERE person_id = 1 AND valid_to = '9999-12-31';

-- Insert new record with updated information
INSERT INTO persons (person_id, name, age, address, valid_from, created_at)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 31, ...
```
# 3. Considerations in Historical Data Modeling
Performance: History tables can grow large, so indexing and partitioning strategies might be necessary to maintain performance.

Data Integrity: Ensure that your triggers or procedures are correctly implemented to avoid data inconsistencies.

Retention Policies: Decide how long to keep historical data and whether to archive or purge old records periodically.

Compliance and Security: Historical data often contains sensitive information, so ensure it’s stored securely and complies with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR).

Querying Historical Data: Ensure your schema supports efficient querying of historical data. This might involve using specific SQL constructs like FOR SYSTEM_TIME in SQL Server for temporal tables or designing queries that join the main table with the history table.



# 4. Conclusion
Modeling history tables and fields in your schema is a powerful way to track data changes and maintain a comprehensive audit trail. By carefully designing your schema and implementing the right strategies for managing historical data, you can ensure that your application can handle temporal queries effectively, maintain data integrity, and support long-term data analysis.

## Best Practices
- **Use Standardized Date Formats:** Ensure consistency in date formats.
- **Index Temporal Columns:** Improve query performance by indexing time-related columns.
- **Handle Temporal Anomalies:** Implement mechanisms to handle overlapping intervals and missing data.
- **Document Temporal Design:** Clearly document the temporal aspects of the database schema.

## Conclusion
Temporal database design is essential for applications requiring historical data management and audit trails. By carefully designing the database to handle temporal data, you can ensure data integrity, optimize performance, and facilitate complex queries involving time-based data.
