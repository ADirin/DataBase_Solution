# Exercise: Concurrency Challenges in MariaDB Databases

## Objective:
Understand and analyze concurrency challenges in MariaDB databases and explore techniques to manage and overcome these challenges effectively. By the end of the exercise, students will also explore the concept of views in databases.

## Part 1: Understanding Concurrency Challenges

### Scenario:
Imagine you are working on a high-traffic e-commerce platform where multiple users simultaneously access and update product inventory.

1. **Concurrency Issues**:  
   - User A attempts to purchase a product, reducing its inventory count.
   - User B simultaneously views and attempts to purchase the same product.  
   - User C queries the current inventory to verify availability.

   **Questions:**
   - What potential issues can arise due to concurrent operations?  
   - How might these issues affect the database's consistency, integrity, and performance?  
   - Identify specific concurrency problems such as **dirty reads**, **non-repeatable reads**, and **phantom reads**.

## Part 2: Techniques for Managing Concurrency

### Task:
Match the following techniques with the issues they aim to solve and implement SQL-based examples to demonstrate their use in MariaDB.

### Techniques:
1. **Locks (Pessimistic Concurrency Control)**  
   - Write an example of using `LOCK TABLES` in MariaDB to prevent concurrent access to the same table.  
   - Discuss the trade-offs of using locks (e.g., performance vs. consistency).  

2. **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)**  
   - Explain how MVCC helps resolve conflicts using snapshots of data.  
   - Use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` or `READ COMMITTED` isolation level to illustrate MVCC in action.  

3. **Timestamp-Based Concurrency Control**  
   - Write a query to assign timestamps for transactions and explain how this technique resolves conflicts.

4. **Optimistic Concurrency Control**  
   - Demonstrate the implementation of a version column in a table to detect conflicts.  
   - Write an SQL transaction that handles conflict resolution optimistically.

5. **Pessimistic Concurrency Control**  
   - Use `LOCK IN SHARE MODE` to demonstrate pessimistic locking in MariaDB.

### Questions:
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of each technique in high-concurrency systems?  
- Which technique would you recommend for the e-commerce platform described in Part 1? Why?

## Part 3: Extending the Scenario with Views

### Task:
Create a **view** to manage the inventory display for the e-commerce platform.

1. **Scenario Extension:**
   - Managers want a consistent view of all products' inventory for reporting purposes.  
   - Users should only see products available for sale, without being affected by uncommitted changes from other users.

2. **Steps:**
   - Write an SQL query to create a view that displays product names, available inventory, and last updated timestamps.  
   - Ensure the view reflects data consistency by choosing the appropriate concurrency technique (e.g., use MVCC for consistent snapshots).

3. **Questions:**
   - How does the use of views help in managing database concurrency?  
   - What are the potential limitations of views in this context?  
   - Discuss the impact of using views with different isolation levels.

## Deliverables:
- SQL scripts for implementing each technique.  
- SQL code to create and query the view.
