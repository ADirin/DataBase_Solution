  Study how databases manage concurrent transactions and the various isolation levels to prevent data anomalies.

### Week 3 (02.9.-03.9.)

- **Mon:** Concurrent Use: Locks & Versioning  
  Examine locking mechanisms and versioning strategies for handling simultaneous data access and modification.
- **Tue:** Views  
  Understand how to create and use views to simplify complex queries and enhance data abstraction.

### Week 4 (09.9.-10.9.)

### Week 5 (16.9.-17.9.)

- **Mon:** ORM with JPA: A Single Class  
  Begin exploring Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) with Java Persistence API (JPA) by working with single-class mappings.
- **Tue:** ORM with JPA: One-to-Many Associations  
  Extend your knowledge to one-to-many relationships in JPA, crucial for modeling complex data interactions.

### Week 6 (23.9.-24.9.)

- **Mon:** ORM with JPA: Many-to-Many & One-to-One Associations, Inheritance  
  Learn about more advanced JPA mappings, including many-to-many, one-to-one associations, and inheritance strategies.
- **Tue:** ORM with JPA: JPQL & Criteria API  
  Study Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) and the Criteria API for building dynamic queries.

### Week 7 (30.9.-01.10.)

- **Mon:** ORM with JPA: Converters, Events, Object-Level Concurrency Control  
  Explore converters for data transformation, event handling, and techniques for managing object-level concurrency.
- **Tue:** JPA Workshop  
  Participate in a workshop focused on JPA, with no face-to-face lectures; online sessions available on demand. This week includes the final exam.

### Week 8 (07.10.-08.10.)

- **Mon:** First Resit  
  Opportunity for students to retake the exam if necessary.
- **Tue:** Second Resit  
  Additional chance for students to resit the exam.

## Home Assignments

Starting from the second week, home assignments will be given. These assignments are mandatory and optionally may be completed in pairs. Students are required to present their solutions during the exercise sessions. Successful completion of these assignments is necessary to participate in the final exam.

## Important Notes

- **Participation:** Attendance and active participation in all lectures are compulsory.
- **Assistant Opportunity:** If you are interested in becoming an assistant for the course, please express your interest during the first lecture. As an assistant, your role will involve assessing other students' work. You should have a comprehensive knowledge of programming (Java) and a basic understanding of databases.

## Course Completion

To successfully complete the course, students must meet the following criteria:

1. **80% Lecture Participation:** Attend and participate in at least 80% of the lectures.
2. **Home Assignments:** Complete and present all mandatory home assignments.
3. **Final Exam:** Pass the final exam.

This course aims to equip you with the essential skills needed for effective database management and optimization, preparing you for real-world challenges in the field. We look forward to an engaging and productive learning experience!
