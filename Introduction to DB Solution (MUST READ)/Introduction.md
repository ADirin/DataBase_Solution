# Description of the Figure

- **Week 1:** Focuses on foundational concepts such as Temporal Databases and Indexing, setting the base for performance and query handling.

- **Week 2:** Introduces Query Optimization and Concurrent Use topics, enhancing understanding of efficient query execution and transaction management.

- **Week 3:** Delves into advanced concurrency control mechanisms like Locks and Versioning, and introduces Views to simplify complex queries.

- **Week 4:** Covers advanced database features including Triggers, Stored Procedures, and Events, and discusses User Accounts, Security, and Backups.

- **Week 5:** Begins the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) journey with JPA, starting with single-class mappings and moving to One-to-Many associations.

- **Week 6:** Expands on ORM with more complex relationships such as Many-to-Many and One-to-One associations, and inheritance strategies in JPA.

- **Week 7:** Focuses on advanced JPA features like JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language), Criteria API, Converters, and Object-Level Concurrency Control.

- **Week 8:** Concludes with the final exam and offers opportunities for resits, consolidating all learned concepts and assessing overall competence.
