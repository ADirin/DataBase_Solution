  Study Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) and the Criteria API for building dynamic queries.

### Week 7 (30.9.-01.10.)

- **Mon:** ORM with JPA: Converters, Events, Object-Level Concurrency Control  
  Explore converters for data transformation, event handling, and techniques for managing object-level concurrency.
- **Tue:** JPA Workshop  
  Participate in a workshop focused on JPA, with no face-to-face lectures; online sessions available on demand. This week includes the final exam.

### Week 8 (07.10.-08.10.)

- **Mon:** First Resit  
  Opportunity for students to retake the exam if necessary.
- **Tue:** Second Resit  
  Additional chance for students to resit the exam.

## Home Assignments

Starting from the second week, home assignments will be given. These assignments are mandatory and must be completed in pairs. Students are required to present their solutions during the exercise sessions. Successful completion of these assignments is necessary to participate in the final exam.

## Important Notes

- **Participation:** Attendance and active participation in all lectures are compulsory.
- **Assistant Opportunity:** If you are interested in becoming an assistant for the course, please express your interest during the first lecture. As an assistant, your role will involve assessing other students' work. You should have a comprehensive knowledge of programming (Java) and a basic understanding of databases.

## Course Completion

To successfully complete the course, students must meet the following criteria:

1. **80% Lecture Participation:** Attend and participate in at least 80% of the lectures.
2. **Home Assignments:** Complete and present all mandatory home assignments.
3. **Final Exam:** Pass the final exam.

This course aims to equip you with the essential skills needed for effective database management and optimization, preparing you for real-world challenges in the field. We look forward to an engaging and productive learning experience!
