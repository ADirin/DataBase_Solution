# Description of the Figure

- **Week 1:** Focuses on foundational concepts such as Temporal Databases and Indexing, setting the base for performance and query handling.

- **Week 2:** Introduces Query Optimization and Concurrent Use topics, enhancing understanding of efficient query execution and transaction management.

- **Week 3:** Delves into advanced concurrency control mechanisms like Locks and Versioning, and introduces Views to simplify complex queries.

- **Week 4:** Covers advanced database features including Triggers, Stored Procedures, and Events, and discusses User Accounts, Security, and Backups.

- **Week 5:** Begins the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) journey with JPA, starting with single-class mappings and moving to One-to-Many associations.

- **Week 6:** Expands on ORM with more complex relationships such as Many-to-Many and One-to-One associations, and inheritance strategies in JPA.

- **Week 7:** Focuses on advanced JPA features like JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language), Criteria API, Converters, and Object-Level Concurrency Control.

- **Week 8:** Concludes with the final exam and offers opportunities for resits, consolidating all learned concepts and assessing overall competence.


## Course Schedule

### Week 1 (19.8.-20.8.)

- **Mon:** Introduction to Databases & Temporal Databases  
  Explore foundational database concepts and delve into temporal databases, which handle time-related data efficiently.
- **Tue:** Indexing & Performance Simulations  
  Learn about indexing techniques to enhance database performance and engage in simulations to observe their impact.

### Week 2 (26.8.-27.8.)

- **Mon:** Query Optimization  
  Focus on methods for optimizing queries to ensure they run as efficiently as possible.
- **Tue:** Concurrent Use: Transactions & Isolation Levels  
  Study how databases manage concurrent transactions and the various isolation levels to prevent data anomalies.

### Week 3 (02.9.-03.9.)

- **Mon:** Concurrent Use: Locks & Versioning  
  Examine locking mechanisms and versioning strategies for handling simultaneous data access and modification.
- **Tue:** Views  
  Understand how to create and use views to simplify complex queries and enhance data abstraction.

### Week 4 (09.9.-10.9.)

- **Mon:** Triggers, Stored Procedures & Events  
  Delve into advanced database features like triggers, stored procedures, and events to automate and manage database operations.
- **Tue:** User Accounts, Security & Backups  
  Learn about managing user accounts, securing databases, and implementing backup strategies. Backup Video Tutorial and Grant Privilege Guide.

### Week 5 (16.9.-17.9.)

- **Mon:** ORM with JPA: A Single Class  
  Begin exploring Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) with Java Persistence API (JPA) by working with single-class mappings.
- **Tue:** ORM with JPA: One-to-Many Associations  
  Extend your knowledge to one-to-many relationships in JPA, crucial for modeling complex data interactions.

### Week 6 (23.9.-24.9.)

- **Mon:** ORM with JPA: Many-to-Many & One-to-One Associations, Inheritance  
  Learn about more advanced JPA mappings, including many-to-many, one-to-one associations, and inheritance strategies.

## Home Assignments

Starting from the second week, home assignments will be given. These assignments are mandatory and optionally may be completed in pairs. Students are required to present their solutions during the exercise sessions. Successful completion of these assignments is necessary to participate in the final exam.

## Important Notes

- **Participation:** Attendance and active participation in all lectures are compulsory.
- **Assistant Opportunity:** If you are interested in becoming an assistant for the course, please express your interest during the first lecture. As an assistant, your role will involve assessing other students' work. You should have a comprehensive knowledge of programming (Java) and a basic understanding of databases.
