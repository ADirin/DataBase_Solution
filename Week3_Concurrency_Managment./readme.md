## Introduction to Concurrency

Concurrency in databases refers to the ability of the database to allow multiple transactions to access the same data concurrently, which helps in maximizing performance and ensuring that users can perform operations without significant delays.

## Concurrency Management

Concurrency management involves techniques and mechanisms to handle the simultaneous execution of transactions in a way that maintains the consistency and integrity of the database.

### Locking Mechanisms

MariaDB provides various types of locks to ensure data integrity. Here are some examples:

```sql
-- Explicit locking
LOCK TABLES accounts WRITE;

-- Perform operations
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;

-- Unlock tables
UNLOCK TABLES;
```
## Isolation Levels
Isolation levels define the degree to which the operations in one transaction are isolated from those in other transactions.

```sql
-- Setting the isolation level to REPEATABLE READ
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;

-- Start a transaction
START TRANSACTION;

-- Perform operations
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1;

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```
Concurrency Techniques
Different techniques are used to manage concurrency in databases:

Pessimistic Locking
Involves locking the data when a transaction starts so that other transactions cannot access it until the lock is released.

Optimistic Locking
Allows multiple transactions to access the same data concurrently but checks for conflicts before committing changes.

Timestamp Ordering
Transactions are ordered based on timestamps to ensure that older transactions are given priority.

Importance of Handling Concurrency
Handling concurrency is crucial for several reasons:

Data Integrity: Ensures that data remains accurate and consistent even when accessed by multiple transactions simultaneously.
Performance: Improves the performance and responsiveness of the database system.
User Experience: Provides a smooth and seamless experience for users by allowing multiple operations to occur concurrently.


# Race Conditions
Race conditions occur when two or more transactions simultaneously access and modify the same data, leading to unexpected results and data inconsistencies.

## Example of Handling Race Conditions
```sql
-- Transaction 1
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
-- Waits for Transaction 2 to release the lock

-- Transaction 2
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;
-- Waits for Transaction 1 to release the lock

-- MariaDB will detect the deadlock and roll back one of the transactions
```

# Concept of View
A view in a database is a virtual table created based on a SQL query. It can be used to simplify complex queries, provide a layer of security, and manage data more efficiently.

## Creating and Using Views
```sql
-- Creating a view to simplify a complex query
CREATE VIEW customer_orders AS
SELECT customers.name, orders.order_date, orders.amount
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;

-- Using the view to fetch data
SELECT * FROM customer_orders WHERE name = 'John Doe';
```
By understanding and implementing these concepts, you can effectively manage concurrency in MariaDB, ensuring data integrity, improving performance, and providing a better user experience.
