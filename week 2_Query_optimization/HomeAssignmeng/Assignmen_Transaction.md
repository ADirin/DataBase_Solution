# Assignment: Transactions and concurrency control

Goal:

```
The goal of this assignment is to learn to work with transactions and isolation levels.
```
Instructions:

```
This is an individual assignment. The deliverables are specified in the end of the assignment.
```
```
 Checking the isolation levels:
SELECT @@GLOBAL.tx_isolation, @@tx_isolation;
```
```
 Setting the session isolation level (to READ_UNCOMMITTED in the example below):
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
The command affects the new transactions.
```
```
 Setting the server isolation level (to READ_UNCOMMITTED):
SET GLOBAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
The command affects the new database connections.
```
```
 See https://mariadb.com/kb/en/set-transaction/
```
```
The database creation script is located in Oma workspace folder Documents/Data.
```
```
All the tasks can be done with HeidiSQL. First, connect to your database server.
```
```
Create the bank database and take it into use:
```
```
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS Bank;
```
```
CREATE DATABASE Bank;
```
```
USE Bank;
```
```
Download the database creation script Bank_script.sql and run it. Get acquainted with the
resulting database.
```
```
First, check the isolation levels and set the server’s and the session’s isolation levels to
REPEATABLE_READ if they are something else.
```
Tasks:

1. In MariaDB you can execute a transaction by giving the operation commands between
    START TRANSACTION; and COMMIT; commands as follows:

## START TRANSACTION;

```
SQL-command 1;
SQL-command 2;
...
```

## COMMIT;

```
Write and execute a transaction that transfers 150 euros form account 100 to account 103.
The transaction consists of two UPDATE commands. Check the final balances of accounts
100 and 103 with SELECT commands. What are the balances?
```
2. Repeat the previous, but instead of committing, cancel the transaction with ROLLBACK;
    command. What happens? What are the final balances?
3. Open simultaneously two MariaDB sessions in their own command windows: in HeidiSQL
    click File/New window and create another connection to the database server.

```
In the first session write a similar transaction as previously, which transfers 200 euros from
account 101 to account 102, but do not commit the transaction. Check the balances in the
second session. What do you observe?
```
4. Now commit the transaction in the first session. Check the balances in both sessions once
    again. What do you observe?
5. Let’s check if phantom reads are possible. Now create two transactions, each in its own
    connection:
       1. TR1: empty the account number 105 (balance becomes 0)
       2. TR2: Read the balance of account 105. Read the balance of account 105. Read
          the balance of account 105. Read the balance of account 105.

```
Write the operations in different windows in the following order. Pay special attention to the
results of reading in rows 3, 5 and 7.
```
1. Start TR1.
2. Start TR2.
3. TR2: Read balance of account 105. Result?
4. TR1: Decrease the balance of 105 to zero.
5. TR2: Read balance of account 105 Result?
6. Commit TR1.
7. Read balance of account 105 Result?
8. Commit TR2.

```
What do you observe? How is the reading of uncommitted transaction at row 5 handled?
```
6. For both connections, change the isolation level to READ UNCOMMITTED.

```
Change the balance of account 105 to 1000 euros, and then repeat the transactions in task
5 with the new isolation level. How does the action differ from the previous case?
```
7. Change the isolation level of both sessions to the safest level (SERIALIZABLE).

```
Restore again the balance of 105 to 1000 euros and repeat the transactions in task 5.
What happens?
```
8. Repeat the previous task so that when transaction TR1 starts waiting, you do not commit
    transaction TR2, but let time pass at least for 50 seconds. What happens? What is the
    balance of 105 at the end? Why?
